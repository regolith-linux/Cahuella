# Cahuella

GTK+ Theme based on Adwaita using the Nord color palette.

This theme is a derivative of Adwaita-dark based from [GTK+ 3.24.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/3.24.5/gtk/theme/Adwaita).  Divergence is limited to color changes defined in `_colors.css`.

The ability to generate a gtk-2.0 Adwaita theme seem to be lost in the sands of time, as such I am unable to generate a Nord gtk-2.0 theme based on Adwaita's gtk-2.0 theme.  Until the mystery is solved, I ship [Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic)'s gtk-2.0 theme dist files as part of Cahuella.

## Note

This theme is purpose built for Regolith Linux and as such does not include theme data for window managers. I'm happy to take PRs if others would like to add them but do not plan on undertaking this effort myself.

# Cahuella

GTK+ Theme based on Adwaita using the Nord color palette.

This theme is a derivative of Adwaita-dark based from [GTK+ 3.24.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/3.24.5/gtk/theme/Adwaita).  Divergence is limited to color changes defined in `_colors.css`.

The ability to generate a gtk-2.0 Adwaita theme seem to be lost in the sands of time, as such I am unable to generate a Nord gtk-2.0 theme based on Adwaita's gtk-2.0 theme.  Until the mystery is solved, I ship [Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic)'s gtk-2.0 theme dist files as part of Cahuella.
